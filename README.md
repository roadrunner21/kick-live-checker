## Usage

### As a Standalone Tool

To use `ts-kick-scraper` as a standalone CLI tool, you can execute specific scraping tasks from the command line.

#### Check if a Channel is Live
Run the following command with the Kick channel name as an argument:

```bash
node index.js <channelName>
```

Replace `<channelName>` with the name of the Kick channel you want to check.

Example:
```bash
node index.js xqc
```

### As a Dependency

To integrate `ts-kick-scraper` into your project, first install it via npm:

```bash
npm install ts-kick-scraper
```

Then, import and use it in your code. For example, checking a channel's live status:

```javascript
const { checkChannelLiveStatus } = require('ts-kick-scraper');

// Optional: Use your own logger
const winston = require('winston');
const customLogger = winston.createLogger({
level: 'info',
format: winston.format.simple(),
transports: [new winston.transports.Console()]
});

checkChannelLiveStatus('xqc', { logger: customLogger })
.then(result => {
console.log(result);
})
.catch(error => {
console.error(error);
});
```

If you don't provide a custom logger, `ts-kick-scraper` will use its default logging configuration based on the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.
